When I started this site I always planned that it would help me organise information, not just be a blog.  These blog
notes are just my stream of conciousness, with a primary purpose being to think about how and why the real content is
managed.

In that spirit, one of the major things I wanted to organise is a large collection of research papers that I've
been accumulating ever since I first got an Internet connection (1992).  Back in that distant past, I used a 2400 baud
modem.  For anyone unfamiliar, that was 2400 bps.  Yes, really, 2.4 kbps, 0.0024 Mbps, or 0.0000024 Gpbs!  It would take
rather a long time to download anything interesting, so I didn't want to lose them and have to download them again - I
remember spending over 3 hours downloading a single 10 Mbyte paper from MIT.

I could simply just upload everything but I'm not sure that would be very useful.  Instead, I really want to think about
why I care about each one of them.  I wish I could do that in the style of Adrian Colyer's amazing
site [The Morning Paper](http://blog.acolyer.org), but, frankly, I don't have enough time.  Things will be a little
shorter here.

I'll tag any notes about papers under "Research Resources".
