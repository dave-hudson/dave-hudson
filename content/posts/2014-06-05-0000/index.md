About 3 months ago I looked at how the BTC price seems to spike up
approximately every 7 months.  It seems to be happening again!

Over the last couple of weeks the BTC price has reversed its earlier
falls and has yet again started to jump back up again.  The timing is
pretty-much consistent with previous spikes.

Let's look at the graph (plotted on a logarithmic Y axis):

The trend of high points in the graph (red line) shows another
[theme park ride]({{< relref "../2014-03-09-0000" >}}):
The Bitcoin runaway roller coaster.  Like any good thrill ride we see
regular highs and lows; here the peaks are anywhere between 212 days and
235 days, but in general the later ones have been nearer 235 days.  235
days from the last high would be 2014-07-24.  It will be interesting to
see if the current rises follow the same trend and if that's near our
next destination.

While our roller coaster may be an entertaining ride for many, the
gentle slopes of the low point trend (green line) form an intriguingly
steady path.  Perhaps it's this trend that should be attracting far more
attention?
