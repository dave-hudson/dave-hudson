A number of times in the past I've found myself wanting to blog about some of the things I've been reading about, thinking
about, or working on.  Somehow, though, I've never managed to make the habit stick.

I think part of the problem is that I will always be a software developer at heart and prepackaged, WYSIWYG, tools that
have limited flexibility never quite appealed to me (that and disliking the bloaty databases and slow rendering behind
most of them).  The next time I did this I'd already decided I needed to be able to do pretty much everything from a command
line and with my trusty [vim](http://www.vim.org) editor (actually in this case [MacVim](http://macvim.org)).

The other problem is that I've never been entirely satisfied with the idea of just writing a blog.  As a designer, I tend to
think about how things evolve.  The process of creating something is all about changing some part of the world from how it
is to some new form we'd prefer it to have (even if these are just small changes).  A good blog captures a lot of the
change occurring in someone's thinking but doesn't necessarily leave a clear view of how that works out.  I'm going to try
and do something a little different here, and try to capture both.  That's why there's both the blog and the wiki.

I've tried to do something similar previously when I was writing a C++ arbitrary precision maths library called
[c8](http://github.com/hashingitcom/c8/wiki).  In that instance, I used a GitHub wiki to host my blog notes
as I was writing the code and evolving the design, keeping pace alongside the git commits.  While it worked, it was a
pretty painful experience - maintaining all the links and metadata was just a lot of work.

With this new site, however, I'm going back to hosting on GitHub, but I'm now using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) which is very
fast and takes just enough of the pain out of the process.  Using an electric vehicle analogy, I'm really hoping
for it to be more a Tesla than a Sinclair C5, but we're a bit too early for any would-be motoring critics just yet.

So far, so good, however.  I've been travelling this week (opening a new [R3](http://r3.com) Engineering office in Dublin)
but it's only taken a few hours to find the tooling, read the docs, and get something up and running.

And thus, the journey begins!
