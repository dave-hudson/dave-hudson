Bitcoin mining can be a very profitable activity.  It's good that it is
because Bitcoin, as a system, only works because of the mining activity;
it's the mining that ensures the transactions actually take place.  Just
how much money does it generate though and does this help us make any
predictions for the future?

Like mining any other finite resource, Bitcoin mining gets harder over
time and requires more investment to mine profitably.  Mining requires a
capital outlay to buy mining equipment, incurs operating costs to keep
it running and is ultimately only successful if, over the useful life of
the mining equipment, the value of what's mined is higher than the
total costs to mine it.

For Bitcoin the mining rewards seem pretty simple to estimate: The
current (2014-04-03) fixed block reward is 25 BTC and there are a
nominal 144 blocks per day.  This yields a nominal 3600 BTC per day.  1
BTC is currently worth about \$450 (USD) so that's \$1.62M being mined
per day. In practice though, this underestimates the mining reward for a
couple of reasons:

- The difficulty level is going through a rapid (exponential) growth
  that means we're seeing far more than 144 blocks mined per day.
- The mining activity also earns the successful miner any transaction
  fees.

## Blocks Mined Per Day

Bitcoin was set up to try to track the amount of hashing capacity in the
total network and to adjust the difficulty of the next batch of blocks
every 2016 block (nominally every 2 weeks).  The aim is to try to have
the next 2016 blocks take 2 weeks to complete.  Between the adoption of
GPUs and the introduction of ASICs for mining this actually worked out
quite well but the huge increases in hashing capacity enabled by ASICs
have meant that the difficulty level has lagged behind.  [ASIC

limits will eventually slow this but not for some months at least.

The impact of steadily increasing hashing rates can be seen when we look
at the date at which the fixed block reward halves.  The genesis block
was created on 2009-01-03, with the first mined block being on
2009-01-09.  The fixed reward halves every 210000 blocks so at 144 blocks
per day this should have been 1458 days later, or 2013-01-06.  In
practice block 210000 occurred on 2012-11-28, some 39 days earlier.

If we consider more recent trends the effect is even more marked.
Between blocks 210000 and 294000 there should have been 583.3 days, but
we actually reached block 294000 in just 490 days.  Over 19 months of
hashing work was completed in a little over 16 months.  Our average
number of blocks per day has been slightly more than 171.  In fact most
of the gain has come in the last 14 months so the average block rate has
been higher still.

For the next few months at least it seems likely that we'll see this
much larger average block rate so based on our original \$450 per BTC
then we get a fixed reward per day of \$1.92M; this is \$300k per day
more than we might have guessed.  The downside, of course, is that while
there's more money being made now, so the date of the next halving of
the reward is moving closer.  Instead of being in November 2016 it's
already moved to August 2016 and, unless something unexpected happens,
will almost certainly happen a month or two before that.

## Transaction Fees

Bitcoin mining was designed to steadily move from a phase where mining
was about collecting the fixed per-block reward of new coins to one in
which transaction fees represented the majority of what a successful
miner gained.  So far the numbers of transactions haven't been high
enough to provide significant rewards from the fees and they're
typically only generating about 10-15 BTC per day.  It's not
unreasonable to state that Bitcoin needs transaction fees to become a
larger part of the system otherwise the reduction in the fixed mining
reward will be a serious problem.

Typically miners will invest in the best hardware available in order to
maximize their returns but that investment is funded by what they mine.
If there's not a major increase in the value of transaction fees when
the fixed mining reward halves again then there's an equally strong
risk that mining investments will drop substantially.  Given that mining
uses highly specialized hardware and that the hardware comes from highly
specialized companies then any such drop poses a serious risk to the
profitability of companies supplying the virtual picks and shovels!

## Chickens And Eggs Part 2

In an earlier article, "[Chickens And Eggs?]({{< relref "../2014-03-17-0000">}})", I
speculated about the relationship between hashing rates and BTC price.
In retrospect it seems a more interesting comparison is between hashing
rates and the total daily miners' reward.  Here's that new chart:

![Bitcoin hashing rate compared with total mining rewards April
2014](./hash-vs-reward.png)

As with earlier charts both of these traces are plotted on logarithmic
axes but the two lines are spaced apart a little to make comparisons
easier.

If we consider that a state-of-the-art Bitcoin mining platform can
generate a little over 300 MHash/s/\$ then the current worldwide
capacity of 48 PHash/s would require an investment of \$160M.  In
practice most of the hashing capacity is nowhere near as cost effective
as 300 MHash/s/\$ so it seems likely that the actual investment
worldwide in the hardware that is currently running has been more like
\$300M to \$500M.  Given that the hashing rates have been increasing so
dramatically for more than 12 months it's also highly unlikely that
more than a very small fraction of the currently-deployed hardware has
been in use for more than 8 months.

If we look at the estimated miner's reward for the last 8 months it's
\$514M.  This suggests that a huge fraction of the money being made from
mining is now also being spent on mining hardware.  Another jump in the
BTC price will help make things more profitable for miners but will
probably also just trigger yet more spending on mining hardware.  It also
suggests that the correlation between mining hash rates and the BTC
price is certainly more circular than might otherwise seem likely as
purchases of mining hardware has been one of the biggest uses of Bitcoin
itself.

### Limits On Hashing?

The \$514M represents a realistic limit on the hashing rate since no-one
can afford to operate at a loss for long.  Some of that \$514 has to have
been used to cover operating costs such as electricity, HVAC, premises,
and some amount of miner's profit.  Unless ASIC and mining equipment
vendors reduce their prices significantly then that put's an upper
bound of \$514M \* 300 MHash/s/\$; a little over 150 PHash/s.
Realistically it's probably less than 120 PHash/s and that's assuming
that everyone was suddenly able to buy currently-shipping
state-of-the-art equipment.

As ASICs start to hit the limits of the process technology the huge
expansions in the hashing rate will have to slow down and that will
start to change the mining economics again\... seems like something to
write about next time :-)
