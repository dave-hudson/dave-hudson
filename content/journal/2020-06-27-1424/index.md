Federated systems are something that lots of people seem to want, yet they're really difficult to build in practice.
One problem is that it's likely that participants have a misaligned set of incentives

[Identities Evolve - Why federated identity is easier said than done](../../../elements/research-resources/2011-05-SSRN-id2163241.pdf)
nicely articulates some of the problems, and highlights where things have gone awry before.

This paper is 9 years old, so I suspect there are more up-to-date write-ups.  I should probably go and look for some!
