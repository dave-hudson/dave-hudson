Lots of minor style tweaks today.  One of the changes to this site earlier in the week had been to introduce light
and dark mode code syntax highlighting.  Now started to change the colour scheme so that both use similar colours,
albeit adjusted for the backgrounds.

Also changed the "next" and "previous" icons.  These are now much more along the style used on other sites.
