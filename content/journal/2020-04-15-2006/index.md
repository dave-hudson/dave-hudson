The pagination code for this site had been annoying for a while so finally revised that to use icons rather than
text.  At the same time changed from a slightly odd list to a table layout.

Another consideration was to make the markdown links a little more obvious.  These now have a weight of 600 rather
than 400.

As always, found a few weird problems and fixed them.
