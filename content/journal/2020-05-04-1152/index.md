Another day, another Pat Helland article read.  This time
[Idempotence is Not a Medical Condition](../../../elements/research-resources/2012-04-14-idempotence.pdf).

Didn't learn anything new from this, but it's a nice summary of the problems involved in distributed systems
messaging.  It's a good reference to hold onto for anyone who asks.
