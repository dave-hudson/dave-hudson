With the natural and integer number support being ready it's time to think about the other types that we'll
want for a first version of the library.  Added placeholder files for rational, real2 and real10 numbers.

Real2 will be power-of-2 floating point numbers (as with C++ float and double), whereas real10 will be
power-of-10 versions (useful for handling finance problems).
