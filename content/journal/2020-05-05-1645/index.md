More from the Pat Helland back catalogue.  This one, [The End of an Architectural Era (It's Time for a Complete Rewrite)](../../../elements/research-resources/2007-09-end-of-an-architectural-era.pdf)
argues that SQL (relational) databases no longer come close to representing the needs of modern computer hardware or
users.

I tend to agree, although the paper is selling their own solution.  With that said the 82x speedup cited is quite
compelling and we've seen the rise of NoSQL pretty-much backing this up.  The early reasoning in the paper is
probably the most interesting part though.
