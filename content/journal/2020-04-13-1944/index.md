So an hour-long job just took six hours :-(

I decided to move the developer notes from my c8 library to this site.  In the process I discovered that I'd
not set up the pages to handle rendering `<code>` tags properly.  While fixing that I decided the site colour scheme
needed a refresh, and then found a few quirks in the `config.toml`.

No good deed goes unpunished!
