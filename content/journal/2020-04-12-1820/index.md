Over the course of many years I've accumulated dozens of paper notebooks.  I'm not going to try to pull all
them into this site, but I do have other stuff I wrote as notes for myself and I will bring them over.

The starting point for this are the notes I made in 2017 when I built my c8 maths library.  Hopefully this will
also give me the opportunity to format some of these notes better.
