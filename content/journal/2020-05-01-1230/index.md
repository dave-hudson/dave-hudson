## Disqus really isn't friendly to site performance

When I set up this site I added disqus support for the blog pages.  This morning I discovered just how much page bloat
these added, so I'm now removing them.  They were only on the blog pages anyway, and I'm reachable on Twitter or
LinkedIn if anyone really wants to have a conversation about something.

## Images are the wrong size

I've not fixed this yet, but I need to generate images athat match the page width better.  I should be able to do this
with hugo.

## Not a performance issue, but the Twitter cards weren't right

I did discover that I'd not got the Twitter card setup right, however, as there were no images associated with the
site, so I've fixed that too.
