This evening I've been going through several years of accumulated "reading list" content.  Much
of it is far less interesting than I thought it would be at the time I saved it!

I did stumble across one interesting link though.
[Alastair Reid's notes on interesting papers](https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/about/)
suggests an interesting approach to cataloguing research information.  I think I'll try this approach
out here.
