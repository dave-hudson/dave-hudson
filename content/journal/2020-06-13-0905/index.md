description: "Old operating systems papers are really interesting at times"

Read a couple more papers over breakfast!

[The Nucleus of a Multiprogramming System](../../../elements/research-resources/1970-04-MonitorPaper.pdf)
is an interesting insight into how to design an early operating system, especially as relates to building a hierarichal
set of processes.

[Policy/Mechanism Separation in Hydra](../../../elements/research-resources/1975-11-policy-mechanism-hydra.pdf)
describes what must have been one of the first microkernel concepts I've seen so far.  While the paper is very
outdated in terms of the implementation, the approach of only providing mechanisms in the OS kernel and leaving
everything else to a hierarchy of processes still resonates strongly.
