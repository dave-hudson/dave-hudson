Welcome!  This is where I (Dave Hudson) collect things on the Internet.

For a very long time I've been interested in operating systems, programming languages, distributed systems,
networking, and high performance computing.  Much of what you'll find here relates to these.


If something gets my attention, and I have time, I like to write blog [posts]({{< relref "posts" >}}).  When I
started the site I wrote a lot about Bitcoin mining, hence the site name.  I'm still very much active in
the world of distributed ledgers and blockchain, but am more of a passive observer of cryptocurrencies now.

While the blog is where I think aloud, "[elements]({{< relref "elements" >}})" is a space where those thoughts become
more concrete.
