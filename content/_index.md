Welcome to my (Dave Hudson's) space on the Internet.

I collect things I find important under "[Elements]({{< relref "elements" >}})".

If something gets my attention, and I have time, I like to write [Blog]({{< relref "blog" >}}) posts.  When I
started the site I wrote a lot about Bitcoin mining, hence the site name.  I'm still very much active in
the world of distributed ledgers and blockchain, but am a less active observer of cryptocurrencies now.

A long time ago I discovered I needed to keep track of things I'm doing.  My latest experiement in this is
the "[Journal]({{< relref "journal" >}})".  The journal is just somewhere for me to think aloud - it's definitely
not definitive!
