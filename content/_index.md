Welcome!  This is where I (Dave Hudson) collect things on the Internet.

For a very long time I've been interested in operating systems, programming languages, distributed computing,
and high performance computing.  Much of what you'll find here relates to these.
When something gets my attention, and I have time, then I like to write [blog posts]({{< relref "posts" >}}).

For a while I wrote extensively about Bitcoin mining.  I'm still very much active in the world of distributed
ledgers and blockchain, but am more of a passive observer of cryptocurrencies now.

While the blog is where I think aloud, "[elements]({{< relref "elements" >}})" is a space where those thoughts become
more concrete.
